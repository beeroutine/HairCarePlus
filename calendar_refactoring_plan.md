# Calendar Refactoring Plan

## Architecture Issues

### Current Issues
1. **Tight coupling** between ViewModels and Views
2. **Limited separation of concerns** in the calendar logic
3. **Inefficient state management** for calendar events and restrictions
4. **Inconsistent theme handling** across calendar components
5. **Mixed responsibilities** in CalendarViewModel (managing both calendar and event data)
6. **Limited testability** due to direct dependencies

### Refactoring Goals
1. Improve separation of concerns
2. Enhance maintainability and testability
3. Optimize performance
4. Create a more consistent user experience
5. Support advanced calendar features

## Component Structure Refactoring

### 1. Separate Calendar Logic from UI
- Create a dedicated `CalendarService` that handles all date calculations
- Move calendar-specific logic out of ViewModels
- Implement unit tests for calendar logic

### 2. Event Management Improvements
- Implement a dedicated `EventManager` to handle all event operations
- Create proper aggregation of events and restrictions in the service layer
- Add support for event filtering, sorting, and grouping
- Implement caching mechanisms for better performance

### 3. Unified Data Model
- Create a single, consistent event model that can represent all types of calendar items
- Use inheritance or composition to handle specialized event types
- Enhance metadata for better categorization and filtering

## UI/UX Refactoring

### 1. Component-Based Approach
- Split calendar into reusable components (header, day grid, event list)
- Implement proper binding to improve responsiveness
- Create specialized event display components based on event type

### 2. Style Consistency
- Create a unified styling system for all calendar elements
- Implement proper theme support at all levels
- Use resource dictionaries for consistent colors and styles

### 3. Enhanced Interaction Model
- Implement proper drag-and-drop for event rescheduling
- Add swipe gestures for navigating between months
- Improve accessibility support

### 4. Visual Hierarchy Improvements
- Create clearer differentiation between event types
- Enhance information density without sacrificing readability
- Implement collapsible/expandable event details

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Data Loading
- Implement lazy loading for events
- Add pagination for large event lists
- Optimize calendar rendering for faster month transitions

### 2. State Management
- Reduce unnecessary data fetching
- Implement proper caching of calendar data
- Add incremental updates for calendar events

### 3. UI Rendering
- Use virtualization for event lists
- Optimize visual tree for calendar components
- Reduce layout passes during calendar navigation

## Technical Debt Reduction

### 1. Code Organization
- Clean up namespace organization
- Improve naming conventions
- Add proper documentation

### 2. Error Handling
- Implement consistent error handling throughout the calendar
- Add proper error recovery mechanisms
- Improve user feedback for error conditions

### 3. Testing
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Implement UI automation tests for key scenarios
- Add performance benchmarks

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Service Layer Refactoring
- Extract calendar logic to dedicated services
- Implement unified event model
- Add proper interfaces for testability

### Phase 2: ViewModel Refactoring
- Redesign ViewModels to use new service layer
- Implement proper state management
- Add support for advanced filtering

### Phase 3: UI Component Redesign
- Implement new component structure
- Enhance visual styling
- Add new interaction capabilities

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Optimize performance
- Refine user experience based on feedback

## Technology Recommendations

1. **State Management**:
   - Consider using a state management library like MvvmLight or Prism
   - Implement a reactive pattern with Observable collections

2. **UI Components**:
   - Consider using Xamarin.CommunityToolkit or Syncfusion controls
   - Build custom controls for specialized calendar features

3. **Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for view models and services
   - Create UI automation tests for critical user flows

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 1 week

Total estimated time: 8 weeks
