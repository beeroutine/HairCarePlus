# Calendar Implementation Summary

## Main Changes Implemented

1. **Dark Theme Support**
   - Added `AppThemeBinding` for proper display of day numbers in both light and dark mode
   - Ensured all text and UI elements respond correctly to theme changes

2. **Day Events Display**
   - Removed popup for showing day's events
   - Added inline display of events below the calendar
   - Styled event items with badges and clear visual indicators for different event types

3. **Consolidated Information Display**
   - Combined all day information (events and restrictions) into a single section
   - Removed separate "Active Restrictions" section
   - Modified `CalendarViewModel` to include restrictions in the day's events collection

4. **Calendar Navigation & UX**
   - Enhanced month navigation with clear buttons
   - Calendar now defaults to today's date and shows today's events when first opened
   - Added day selection with immediate information update

5. **Resolved Ambiguity Issues**
   - Created a new `CleanCalendarViewModel` to avoid ambiguity with `RestrictionTimer` classes
   - Renamed duplicate `RestrictionTimer` class to `RestrictTimerItem` in `RestrictionTimersViewModel.cs`
   - Used namespace aliases to resolve ambiguity between multiple `INotificationService` interfaces
   - Added proper service registration in the DI container
   - Fixed all linter errors related to ambiguous references

## Technical Details

- Implemented `LoadEventsForSelectedDateAsync` in the ViewModel to handle consolidated information display
- Modified styling for better visual distinction between different event types
- Used XAML binding to ensure proper theme support across the entire calendar component
- Created `RestrictionTimerViewModel` to replace ambiguous `RestrictionTimer` implementations
- Added proper namespace qualifications to avoid type conflicts

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Architecture Improvements**
   - Continue refactoring to better separate concerns in the calendar architecture
   - Consider using repository pattern for data access

2. **UX Enhancements**
   - Improve event interactions (add, delete, modify)
   - Add animations for smoother transitions

3. **Code Organization**
   - Complete the consolidation of ViewModels to use the new `CleanCalendarViewModel`
   - Remove or refactor the original `CalendarViewModel` once the new implementation is stable
   - Fix remaining build errors related to the `EventType` enum and `MonthCalendarView`

4. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for ViewModels
   - Perform integration testing on the calendar feature
